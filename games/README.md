# [GamblingTec Casino Games](https://www.gamblingtec.com)

## Overview

The following is a list of games we offer to our casino merchants. Each game has a specific set of instructions in order to be integrated into your
casino brand and we therefore suggest you familiarise yourself with each games requirements.

## Integration types
**Multi tenant solution** is a single game instance that many casino brands use. These are relatively simple to install.

**Bespoke solution** is a single game instance designed for a single merchant. If the merchant has their own licensing, we act purely as a software service provider
integrating their games into payment solutions and customer management systems. If the merchant wishes to use our licensing and infrastructure, we act both
as a software provider and a service provider.

Do note that bespoke solutions take time to setup due to the unique requirements of each merchant. Game vendors in most instances require
upfront fees in order to commence with a project and you will be looking to spend a fair penny to get a bespoke solution up and running.
