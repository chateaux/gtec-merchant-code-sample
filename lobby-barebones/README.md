# [GamblingTec Bare Bones Lobby Test](https://www.gamblingtec.com)

This is a quick and nasty bare bones example of GamblingTec integrated into an html page. It uses javascript and HTML.

## Overview

This is a simple one page HTML/Javascript application that provides the basics to setup a GamblingTec.com casino. We do not
offer support for this particular example and suggest looking at: [Lobby Bootstrap](https://github.com/sunsevennv/gamblingtec-code-samples/tree/master/lobby-bootstrap)
for a maintained example of our code.
